Hi, I'm a second-year computer science student at UC San Diego with experience and skills in front-end web development, AI, and Machine Learning. Having a passion for learning new things, I am always seeking out opportunities to learn new technology and cutting-edge solutions both inside and outside the classroom. 

In my spare time, I like to explore new genres of music and play instruments too! Currently working on learning guitar by myself.

## Experiences 💼

**[Triton Software Engineering](https://tse.ucsd.edu) | Software Developer**
- I worked as a front-end developer with a cross-functional team for the nonprofit Fixnation's landing page, creating a responsive masthead, roadmap, mobile stats page, and interactive quiz components.
- I used HTML, CSS, Typescript, and SvelteKit to develop the website.

**[Comet College Applications Task Manager](https://applywithcomet.com) | Software Engineer Intern**
- I provided strategic software consultation and analyzed UI/UX to help test and improve it for public use.
- During my time as an intern, I researched and reported findings on improving Comet’s search engine performance with inverted indexing and NoSQL databases, developed a Python picture-to-JSON transcript reader that converted images into data structures to make reading transcript info faster and easier, and created a chat app using CometChat widget and Firebase to allow one-to-one counseling.
 
## Projects 💡

**[ReViSE: Reconstructing Visual Stimuli from EEG Signals](https://github.com/Utterbackian/Neuromatch2023_Medical_Imaging)**

- Created a generative deep learning model using PyTorch to reconstruct the images from 128-channel EEG data. 
- Applied a LSTM model to extract visual features from 20,000 EEG data and inputted the processed data into a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversary Network to train and generate images.
- Developed model for possible future applications such as allowing the paralyzed to communicate, forensic analysis by identifying suspects, and dream visualization.

**[ToiFall: Wifi CSI Activity Recognition](https://github.com/EdwardLinS/ToiFall)**

- Classification machine learning model with Python to detect elderly restroom falls with 80% accuracy. Took Channel State Information (CSI) as input and used Support Vector Machine Classification to identify the type of action the CSI recorded.

**[Visual Question Answering App](https://github.com/EdwardLinS/Visual-QA)**

- Python program utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network Long Short-Term Memory Model (CNN-LSTM) to help the visually impaired distinguish their surroundings. Used question text and image as input to return sentence output.

**[Facial Emotion Detection Project](https://github.com/EdwardLinS/Facial-Emotion-Detection)**

- Python computer vision program using CNN to accurately classify five facial emotions for individuals with autism spectrum disorder to identify human emotions.
