Hi, I'm a first-year computer science student at UC San Diego with experience and skills in front-end web development, AI, and Machine Learning. Having a passion for learning new things, I am always seeking out opportunities to learn new technology and cutting-edge solutions both inside and outside the classroom. 

In my spare time, I like to explore new genres of music and play instruments too! Currently working on learning guitar by myself.
