Hi, I'm a first-year computer science student at UC San Diego with experience and skills in front-end web development, AI, and Machine Learning. Having a passion for learning new things, I am always seeking out opportunities to learn new technology and cutting-edge solutions both inside and outside the classroom. 

In my spare time, I like to explore new genres of music and play instruments too! Currently working on learning guitar by myself.

## Projects

**[ToiFall: Wifi CSI Activity Recognition](https://github.com/EdwardLinS/ToiFall)**

- Classification machine learning model with Python to detect elderly restroom falls with 80% accuracy. Took Channel State Information (CSI) as input and used Support Vector Machine Classification to identify the type of action the CSI recorded.

**[Visual Question Answering App](https://github.com/EdwardLinS/Visual-QA)**

- Python program utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network Long Short-Term Memory Model (CNN-LSTM) to help the visually impaired distinguish their surroundings. Used question text and image as input to return sentence output.

**[Facial Emotion Detection Project](https://github.com/EdwardLinS/Facial-Emotion-Detection)**

- Python computer vision program using CNN to accurately classify five facial emotions for individuals with autism spectrum disorder to identify human emotions.
